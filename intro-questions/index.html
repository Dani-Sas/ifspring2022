        <h1>These are my answers to my intro questions</h1>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li>
            <p>Dani Sas. Communication Design with a focus in narrative storytelling. Fourth year but I’ll be here for 5 years so am I really a senior yet?.</p>
            <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>
            <p>My background is originally in engineering so any coding knowledge I have is with regards to having a physical thing react to the code that I input. When switching to Comdez, this was one of my required classes and I thought I would enjoy learning about designing and using web design in ways to tell stories.</p>
            <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li>
            <p>I took this class last semester but didn’t pass it so I have about half a semester's worth of experience that I'm hoping to build on!</p>
            <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>
            <p>I would like to learn how to use interactivity to tell a story. Like how to use buttons in interesting ways and how to implement video and images onto a page to provide an experience to the user.</p>
            <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>
            <p>For me, I struggle with not having a physical thing be made when I create and when creating for a website, its hard to really set into my brain that I’ve accomplished something. I think I need to rework my brain to acknowledge that creating for the screen is creating.</p>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p>I personally believe that the <a href="https://www.clipstudio.net/en/ ">Clip Studio Paint</a> website applies incredibly effective design. From the get go, you can navigate it incredibly easily while it constantly reminds you what this platform is used for by showing you images of art made by it. Its also relatively simple in the way it structures information, making it not overwhelming for the user to get through.</p>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p> I think this <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/best-resume-fonts-you-cant-go-wrong-with-according-ceo-who-reads-thousands-of-resumes-a-year.html">CNBC Article</a> effectively shows off its content, especially compared to other articles like it. By breaking up each paragraph with an image showing the font in action, it allows the user to visualize how they would use this font in their own work.</p>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p>Out of all the websites I use on a daily basis, i feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ ">Youtube</a> is one of the ones that works the most consistently. Hosting truly countless amounts of videos on its platforms, it allows for the user to find the videos they want to watch pretty easily. There is something to be said about the algorithm it implements, and how that hurts creators, but as a website that is meant to upload and watch videos, I feel like it does that job seamlessly.</p>
