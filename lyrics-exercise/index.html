            <p>[<em>Verse 1</em>]</p>
            <p>Today would have been the perfect day to go to the beach</p>
            <p>I'm on the sofa trying to get over a hate speech</p>
            <p>We do not love ourselves the way the prophets teach</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>
                Even Jesus kept his feelings like a lamp in the dark</p>
            <p>Until he flipped the tables over up in the market</p>
            <p>Oh Mother, there are lamps but there are sparks</p>

            <br>

            <p>[<em>Chrous</em>]</p>
            <p>But I need to know</p>
            <p>I don’t need to be shown</p>
            <p>I've gotta see it for myself</p>
            <p>I've gotta learn it on my own</p>
            <p>I need to know if I am flesh & bone</p>
            <p>And am I still growing or full grown?</p>
            <p>Am I still growing, or full grown?</p>
            <p>Oh, ooh, yeah</p>

            <br>

            <p>[<em>Verse 2</em>]</p>
            <p>She’s coming up for the rising like the dark before dawn</p>
            <p>She has come to a place and she feels like her love’s gone</p>
            <p>She has come of an age and a line should be drawn</p>

            <br>

            <p>He’s walking around in a tank top getting caught in a bluff</p>
            <p>Little boys do not cry, don’t you think that you’re hot stuff?</p>
            <p>Its real tough when your daddy don’t call you enough, oh</p>

            <p>[<em>Bridge</em>]</p>
            <p>Striking matches to watch ‘em burn in my childhood bedrooms</p>
            <p>Little time, little water and light, little seed, every bud blooms</p>
            <p>And I've been striking matches to watch ‘em burn in my </p>
            <p>childhood bedrooms, ooh</p>
            <p>Little time, little water and light, little seed, every bud blooms, oh</p>

            <br>

            <p>There are days I need to tell myself I’m doing alright</p>
            <p>My inner child and my ego get caught up in a knife fight</p>
            <p>I get nervous, and then I will get out of sight</p>

            <br>

            <p>'Cause everybody I came up with says that I’m going too slow, </p>
            <p>woah</p>
            <p>But it’s cool though, 'cause I can hear my people when I check </p>
            <p>out the show</p>
            <p>I feel real low</p>

            <br>

            <p>[<em>Chrous</em>]</p>
            <p>'Cause I need to know</p>
