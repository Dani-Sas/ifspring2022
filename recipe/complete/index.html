            <div id="paragraph">Chocolate cake or chocolate gâteau is a cake flavored with melted chocolate, cocoa powder, or both. I have been searching for a great chocolate cake recipe for years. I have found it. My search has ended. I now have THE recipe. If you have ever seen the movie Matilda you will surely remember the scene where the boy is forced to eat the most delicious looking chocolate cake ever. I feel just like that boy when I eat this cake. It is my Matilda chocolate cake for sure. A soft and moist cake inside and a chocolate butter cream icing on the outside make this the most perfect combination.</div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.</li>
                    <li>Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.</li>
                    <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.</li>
                    <div class="recipe-image"> <img src="images/1.jpeg" alt="Baking supplies"></div>
                    <li>Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.</li>
                    <div class="recipe-image"><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Pouring Batter" ></div>
                    <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                    <li>Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.</li>

                  </ol> 

                  <h4>For the frosting</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best results</li>
                    <li>Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.</li>
                    <li>Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.</li>

                    <li>Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!</li>
