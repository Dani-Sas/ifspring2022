      <h1>Chocolate Cake</h1>
      <h3>Chocolate cake or chocolate g√¢teau is a cake flavored with melted chocolate, cocoa powder, or both. I have been searching for a great chocolate cake recipe for years. I have found it. My search has ended. I now have THE recipe. If you have ever seen the movie Matilda you will surely remember the scene where the boy is forced to eat the most delicious looking chocolate cake ever. I feel just like that boy when I eat this cake. It is my Matilda chocolate cake for sure. A soft and moist cake inside and a chocolate butter cream icing on the outside make this the most perfect combination.</h3>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>For The Cake</p>
            <li>Butter and flour for coating and dusting the cake pan</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

            <p>For The Frosting</p>
            <li>1 1/2 cups butter softened</li>
            <li>8 oz cream cheese softened</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>7-8 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>About 1/4 cup milk as needed</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <p>For The Cake</p>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.</li>
            <li>Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!</li>

            <p>For The Frosting</p>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best results</li>
            <li>Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.</li>
            <li>Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Links To Recipe Pages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://thestayathomechef.com/the-most-amazing-chocolate-cake/">This website</a> is the one that I used as my source. I also felt the need to include it as one of my three links because of excelent readability and its ample substitution methods for dealing with multiple dietary restrictions. It takes a bit to get to the recipe because of the substitutions list, but once you get there, the boxed format of having each section of the recipe in a different collumn with good hierarchy makes the entire piece readable all at once on a computer monitor. </li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://addapinch.com/the-best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever/">This webpage</a> may seem simple at first, but when you delve deeper it shows its true colors. Having both a written discription written paragraph by paragraph and boxed recipe like you'd find on a cake recipe box, this allows for multiple types of learners access this recipe which I haven't seen in many other places.</li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/beattys-chocolate-cake-recipe-1947521">This one</a> is just structured really simply. It doesn't do anything flashy but it has all the information categorized near the top of the page which I admire. Often in recipes it takes some scrolling to actually get to the recipe but here, its immediate.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Links To Non-Recipe Pages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.theinfatuation.com/products">The Infatuation</a> categorizes information in a way I really like. Using colored boxes around text that are slightly different then the background color allows each section to be broken up in a really easy to read way. I want to use that to break up sections of my recipe.</li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal's</a> home page is a little overwhelming to me, but is categorized in a way that really effectively uses the space. I think I want to use the way it has multiple collumns to divide my recipe as to allow for the entire thing to be viewed without scrolling.</li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://tsuki.market/">Tsuki's</a> main page uses images to show off its content in a really clean way. It never feels like it distracts from the text while also showing off what the text is describing. Its use of images is something I wanna try to implement into my recipe to show off different aspects of the baking process.</li>
